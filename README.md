# Experiments for CHR 2021

To run scripts for experiments:

NB. The first time a ANNOY index file (for approximate nearest neighbor search) will be built, this may take a while.

Before running, remember to uncompress the embedding files in data directory!

Afterwards the following scripts can be run with terminal:

## Amsterdam City Archives:
> Rscript saa.R

## DLBP
> Rscript dblp.R

## Intermediate output
tsv files in results directory

## Create plots
Rscript plots.R
Generated plots will be in plots directory
